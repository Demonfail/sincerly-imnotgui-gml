##### **Im!GUI** Comes with 5 elements:

* **Label** - A text!
* **Button** - A clicky button! (It comes with *no-draw* variant, Which can be used for "custom" button-like behaviour.)
* **Tabs** - A collection of "Buttons" that acts like one element that returns the index of currently active button, Which can be used for things like switching view panels and such
* **Slider** - An element that can be dragged to adjust it's value
* **TextBox** - An input field which the Users can type into. (Also comes with number-only variant.)


### How-to use:

Just import the `IMNOTGUI.gmez` file from the folder `EXTENSION_GOES_HERE`, In the GameMaker: Studio.

You can check the "demo" project of **ImNotGUI** in `demo-project`, For *GameMaker: Studio 1.*

Fiddling with the *demo*, You can out check how things work and how you should use it.

Feel free to play around with it!
